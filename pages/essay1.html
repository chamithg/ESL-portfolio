            >It was February, 2020. I was in a line of the immigration counter,
            Los Angeles airport with dreams about a new life and future, but it
            didn&rsquo;t take long to burst my dream bubble and start to feel
            like I didn&rsquo;t belong here. &nbsp;I can still remember one
            incident that made me think so. During the immigration process at
            the airport, an officer checked my passport and looked straight at
            me and asked &ldquo;are you Cha..mi..th?&rdquo; He was trying so
            hard to get my name right. The pronunciation was totally
            unacceptable but I said yes. I didn&rsquo;t want to be his headache
            for the next few minutes. Moreover, I didn&rsquo;t want to be
            cringed by repeating my name out loud. But I realized that name is
            going to be a hex and future is going to be a bumpy ride. I
            wasn&rsquo;t wrong. It happened over and over again. This is a very
            common struggle when moving to a new country. It is common for
            immigrants like me to suffer from language barriers and outlandishly
            sounding names. Language can be mastered over time but what about
            names? I noticed that some immigrants Were using western names and
            it ignited a series of struggles in my mind. Should I change the
            name? Or keep it? If I change it, what&rsquo;s next? Is changing the
            name to something Western like &ldquo;Charlie&rdquo; going to fix my
            broken English and make me look like a native citizen?
            ...And&hellip; wait a second, my mom and dad didn&rsquo;t have a son
            named &ldquo;Charlie&rdquo;. Where did this &ldquo;Charlie&rdquo;
            guy come from? Suddenly I started to feel like I was about to mess
            with my origins as well as my name. Also, I doubted how pretending
            to be like someone else affects my self-confidence. Then I decided
            keeping the original name is the way to go. I strongly suggest that
            immigrants should use their real name to keep their connection to
            their origin and culture, as well as to improve their
            self-confidence even though it is really challenging. However,
            having a name that is hard to pronounce could negatively impact on
            their academic or career growth.&nbsp;</span

            >First and foremost, immigrants should keep using their national
            name because it represents their origin, culture and history.
            According to Wartanian in his article &ldquo;Claiming the History in
            Family Names,&rdquo; using the real name earns someone a chance to
            tell the story behind their name. Also, he or she can use names to
            pass down the history and inheritance of their old generations to
            the new generations (Wartanian, par. 3). In order to prove the fact,
            he explains that his family name &ldquo;Vartan&rdquo; means warrior
            and how his grandfather survived the Armenian Genocide just like a
            warrior. However, Wartanian&rsquo;s father muted the conversation of
            their history by using a different Western name instead of his real
            name (Wartanian, par. 17). Just like Wartanian&rsquo;s father, some
            people do not prefer to talk about their history even if they should
            be proud of it. I believe this behavior comes from the natural sense
            of safety. They might think staying quiet is the best approach to
            stay protected. In his childhood, Wartanian did not know anything
            about their history and it made him believe that having a Western
            name like Kevin would help him to fit into the society. However, he
            changed his mind once he got to know the legacy behind his name
            (Wartanian, par. 10). &nbsp;The story can be attributed to many
            non-Western names throughout the world. They often have a connection
            to their heritage, culture, or origin. Changing names may help
            immigrants and future generations of their families to fit into
            their new society, but at the same time they have to segregate
            themselves from their legacy and descendants will never know about
            their origin. This is why I strongly suggest that immigrants should
            keep their names unchanged.&nbsp;</span

            >Secondly, Immigrants should consider keeping their real name since
            using different names can negatively affect their self-confidence.
            There is a good example for this issue in the article &ldquo;After
            being James, Peter, and William, I decided to stick with my Chinese
            name&rdquo;, where Zheping Huang describes his feeling once he
            introduced himself to someone by a different name. Huang mentions,
            &ldquo;I had to stick with James for a little over two years. Though
            I didn&rsquo;t have many encounters with foreigners during that
            period, I still recall an exchange student from Edinburgh, named
            Fiona, looking unconvinced when I introduced myself as &ldquo;James
            Huang.&rdquo; Perhaps my introduction didn&rsquo;t sound confident.
            If so, no wonder: I didn&rsquo;t feel like a James.&rdquo; (Huang,
            par .13). According to him, it is obvious that he made a weak first
            impression. People using several identifications might encounter
            conflicts. First, they have to remember both identities. Then they
            have to categorize all strangers in the society into groups and
            decide which name should be used for each group. Hence, every single
            time they have to make an introduction, they have to go through this
            process. It could take a little bit more time and hesitation,
            resulting in a weak and unconvincing introduction. The exact same
            thing happened to Huang. When the listener does not believe the very
            first words of someone, it ruins that person&rsquo;s
            self-confidence. That is another good reason for immigrants to
            consider keeping their names unchanged.</span

            >As I discussed above, keeping names is great. But there are some
            inevitable drawbacks of keeping names. A person can simply ignore
            the mispronunciation of a random stranger. There is not the end of
            the world. But what if someone&rsquo;s name categorizes that person
            into a detrimental group at the hiring process or academic process?
            &nbsp;Sadly, this is a real-world scenario. Cody Delistraty in his
            article &ldquo;Who wins in the name game?&rdquo; has mentioned
            various facts that proves this stereotype. &ldquo;A 2004 study
            showed that all else being equal, employers selected candidates with
            names like Emily Walsh and Greg Baker for callbacks almost 50
            percent more often than candidates with names like Lakisha
            Washington and Jamal Jones&rdquo; (Delistraty, par .11). Moreover,
            he mentioned the pronounceability of the name could overcome the
            work experience (Delistraty, par .11). &nbsp;According to
            Delistraty&rsquo;s further explanation on name&apos;s impact on
            education, teachers hold lower expectations for the students with
            non-western or Asian names (Delistraty, par .11). These facts
            clearly illustrate that there is a biasness for the name. I believe
            this is a version of a microaggression that started and fueled by
            smaller groups of people who were suffering from xenophobia. They
            use names as a tool to filter out the immigrants even without seeing
            them. I believe this is one legitimate reason that could make
            immigrants change their names.</span

            >As a result of globalization, it is very common to see vividly
            diversified communities in many countries. Especially here in the
            United States, you will not find someone who hasn&apos;t heard or
            used a non-western name. Also, I have noticed, the vast majority of
            people give honest effort on getting another person&rsquo;s name
            right even though it is unfamiliar to them. Most of the time, they
            do not hesitate to apologize about any mispronunciations. That is
            why I strongly believe &nbsp;immigrants should consider keeping
            their real names to keep up the connection with their culture and
            origin, as well as to maintain self-confidence by being real to
            themselves. I really wish I could sum up this story by only
            mentioning the optimistic aspect of keeping names. But the
            real-world prejudice that is built based on the name, don&rsquo;t
            let me do that. Finally, I would say keep the name, but don&rsquo;t
            let it take away your life&rsquo;s opportunities. Each person should
            try really hard to find their own sweet spot between these two
            options. It would not be the same for everyone.</span
