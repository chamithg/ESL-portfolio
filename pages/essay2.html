          >I spent most of my life in my home country Sri Lanka, which is a
          small tropical island and a main tourist attraction of the Asia
          region. Many tourists can be seen at any corner of my country.
          Whenever you see a group of tourists, you will see a native person
          standing next to them, trying to make an interaction with him. Locals
          conduct their own small, unofficial businesses which are related to
          tourism such as guiding them and selling souvenirs. They are extremely
          capable in marketing of their products and services. I really enjoyed
          watching how they interact with foreigners using a few English words
          they know. Most of those locals do not have a proper education.
          Sometimes they don&apos;t even know how to write their name in the
          native language, Sinhala. But they have picked up enough English words
          to interact with tourists and earn some money. For some people, that
          could be the only income source to keep food on the table for their
          families. But&hellip;Is the English language always this generous? it
          is something that needs a further analysis. This is a small example
          that demonstrates the good aspect of world dominance of English.
          English plays a major role for extending the opportunities beyond the
          local market and the global dominance of English fuels it even
          further. However, so-called English dominance crushes the many other
          languages by desaturating the linguistics diversity and vandalizing
          cultures.</span

          >First and foremost, we can&apos;t neglect the huge positive impact
          that is being delivered by the global dominance of English on
          extending career and business opportunities to the global level.
          English can be considered as a general medium of communication between
          different countries and several examples supporting this fact can be
          found in the article &ldquo;Virtually Running America&rdquo; by Robert
          McCrum. India&apos;s Call center industry is one of them. There McCrum
          describes how America&rsquo;s call center jobs were outsourced to the
          employees from India. This industry started from zero and its growth
          skyrocketed within a couple of years. Lots of applicants were in a
          gold rush to snatch a job in a call center. These applicants were
          highly qualified graduates and most importantly they had to be fluent
          in English. There is no American or British English here, only
          Globish, which is a simplified version of global English. Ultimately,
          this call center situation resulted in an increased interest in
          learning English among young Indian generations. (McCrum par. 1 - 8).
          &nbsp; &nbsp;This new industry can be considered a win-win situation
          for both countries. America can save money on wages and India gets
          lots of job opportunities. This is how globalization of English fuels
          developing new industries and opportunities. McCrum mentions another
          example related to Bollywood, which is India&apos;s movie industry.
          According to author, this industry also shows a boom when it comes to
          global popularity and now it has worldwide fan base of 3.6 million
          (McCrum par. 17 - 18). The main reason behind the success of this
          industry is its departure from tradition due to the linguistic and
          cultural change in India today. When Globish becomes more general in
          the local community, its influence changes the movie scenes
          accordingly. Bollywood movie producers also collaborate with Hollywood
          actors in Bollywood movies (McCrum par. 18). Now those movies are not
          only for the Indian community. Ultimately, Bollywood superstars have
          become more famous than Hollywood superstars. This is not a strange.
          We enjoy watching movies in different languages, but when those movies
          share a commonality with us, our interest grows even stronger. Globish
          is that shared commonality. Those examples on India&apos;s call
          centers and film industry demonstrate two of the positive aspects of
          English&apos;s global dominance related to career growth.</span

          >Even though English is so important to communicate internationally,
          its dominance crushes all other languages by desaturating the
          linguistics diversity. Just like the sun makes stars invisible during
          day time, English dominance shines over other languages and decreases
          their popularity. In &ldquo;Behemoth, Bully, Thief: How the English
          Language is Taking over the Planet&rdquo; by Jacob Mikanowski, He
          mentioned &ldquo;It is aspirational: the golden ticket to the worlds
          of education and international commerce, a parent&rsquo;s dream and a
          student&rsquo;s misery, winnower of the haves from the have-nots. It
          is inescapable: the language of global business, the internet,
          science, diplomacy, stellar navigation, avian pathology. And
          everywhere it goes, it leaves behind a trail of dead: dialects
          crushed, languages forgotten, literature mangled.&rdquo; to describe
          the negative aspects of the global dominance of English (Mikanowski
          par. 4). Nowadays this world depends on the concept of learning
          English as the only way to enter the competitive world. Rwanda had the
          same idea, so they switched their national language and educational
          system to English from French in 2008. (Mikanowski par. 10). They
          certainly contributed a lot to the death of their native language
          through this geopolitical action. In terms of individual actions,
          parents tend to push their children to learn English, which separates
          them from their native tongue. children do not have a choice but to
          learn English and it drastically discourages the growth and existence
          of all other languages and literature. Mikanowski also points out that
          in South Korea, parents often have their children undergo tongue
          surgeries to improve their English pronunciation. (Mikanowski par.
          12). It is unacceptable that there is such a bias towards English.
          Learning English is great. But it should be optional. I think the best
          way to figure out this is to let children decide whether they need to
          learn English or not. The native language should be carried forward
          together with the English. That is the only way to prevent the English
          &apos;Behemoth&apos; from desaturating the linguistics
          diversity.</span

          >&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;Global English
          dominance has also resulted in cultural vandalism in addition to the
          effects on linguistic diversity. English language also carries the
          western cultural aspect such as western fashions, western sociological
          behaviors and many more western things. Sometimes they don&apos;t
          collaborate with native cultures of non-western countries. I can turn
          back to my home country, Sri Lanka, to tell what exactly this is.
          Colombo is the capital of Sri Lanka and it is located on the western
          side of the country. The people who live in that area take being
          &ldquo;western side&rdquo; very seriously and they try to use English
          as much as possible. Their fashion is western, their language is
          English, and their behavior is western. Some parents do not even
          bother to teach the native language Sinhala and traditional things to
          their children. You will find several places like shops and high-end
          hotels where you can&apos;t get anything done using the national
          language, Sinhala. They basically use English to define the class of
          the people. They call themselves &ldquo;Cool and Posh&rdquo; just
          because they know some English words. Some locals who don&apos;t speak
          English suffer from this cultural barrier in the western part of the
          country. This is a cultural disaster in my perspective. On the other
          hand, I have seen many Sri Lankan- American parents who are trying to
          teach Sinhala to their American born children to maintain the
          connection to their origins. They respect being bilingual. I
          don&apos;t know why western Sri Lankan people can&apos;t figure this
          out. I believe Sri Lanka is not the only place that native language is
          boycotted. There is an example that resonates with this in the article
          &ldquo;how to tame a wild tongue&rdquo; by Gloria Anzaldua. The author
          mentioned, &ldquo;Chicanas feel uncomfortable talking in Spanish to
          Latinas, afraid of their judgment. Their language was not outlawed in
          their countries. They had a whole lifetime of being immersed in their
          native tongue; generations, centuries in which Spanish was a first
          language, taught in school, heard on the radio and on TV, and read in
          the newspaper.&rdquo; (Anzaldua par.17). Here she explains the
          situation of native American- Spanish people (Chicanas), when it comes
          to freedom of using their language by comparing it to Latinas, who
          were not banned from speaking Spanish. She expresses her outrage at
          having her mother tongue banned in her native land. Just like Sri
          Lanka. I know, this cultural disaster is not something directly
          delivered by English, but the attitude of the people. But we
          can&apos;t ignore that English is the root of it. That is why I
          strongly believe that English vandalizes cultures.</span

          >In conclusion it is very common to see that global English dominance
          is highly effective in crushing other languages and vandalizing
          cultures despite being helpful for enhancing career opportunities and
          economic growth. So, is it an Enemy? Yes and no. It really depends on
          the way people use it. People should use English for their personal or
          career development but they shouldn&apos;t let English define them and
          take them away from their cultures and traditions. English can&rsquo;t
          possess people if they have pride and respect for their own language
          and cultures. If they let those pride and respect fade away, English
          can easily squeeze in. English is like a sharp knife. It can be a
          useful tool or it can hurt the user. So my recommendation is to use
          the tool with caution. That is the only way to stop English from
          crushing other languages and vandalizing cultures.</span
