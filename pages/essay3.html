          >I spent my childhood in a rural area in Sri Lanka, where people
          don&apos;t care much about infrastructure. People did not ask for
          water; they had their own water resources like wells and springs.
          Using firewood, people ignored liquid petroleum gas for cooking. There
          was one thing they couldn&apos;t do without, and that was electricity,
          just like the rest of the world. The necessity for electricity has
          grown rapidly over the years. In Sri Lanka, more than half of that
          electricity is coming from fossil fuel which costs millions of dollars
          each week. &nbsp;Now Sri Lanka is experiencing its worst financial
          crisis of all time due to numerous administrative flaws, including the
          government having unqualified and unethical people handle the
          country&apos;s financial sector, as well as the pandemic. Now there is
          a shortage for most essentials like fossil fuel. Accordingly, the
          government has decided to implement power cuts for 4 - 8 hours each
          day. This situation has crippled the small businesses and day to day
          life of general the community. When People couldn&apos;t bear this
          anymore and their aggression has been turned into nationwide protests
          as it is today. Buying fossil fuels is not the only cause for that
          chaotic situation, but it is a major impact. Government could have
          reduced the pressure on countries foreign reserves if they have found
          a renewable energy source. The rest of the world may think that they
          are protected against power shortages as long as they have a strong
          enough economy to buy fuel. But I believe this could be any country of
          the world once the world runs out of fossil fuel. &nbsp;I believe the
          whole world has recognized the need of transitioning to renewable
          power sources. The question is do they care enough? To find an answer
          for that question, it is best to look at a wealthy country that has
          money to invest in research like the United States rather than a
          country that is already suffering the consequences of not terminating
          its dependence on fossil fuels. When the public preference, government
          actions plans, and feasibility are considered, wind and solar will
          dominate renewable electricity production in the U.S. &nbsp;</span

          >First and foremost, it is worth knowing the present statistics of
          electricity generation in the U.S. Electricity consumption is
          increasing rapidly in the US especially due to the Electric vehicle,
          the future of green transportation. Driving an EV, People enjoy the
          proud feeling of being able to take part in the green and clean air
          community. &nbsp;But they are wrong and right at the same time.
          According to the article &ldquo;Public&nbsp;Preferences in a Shifting
          Energy Future&rdquo; by Hilary S Boudet and Shawn O Hazboun, 60 % of
          the electricity of the US is coming from burning fossil fuel (Natural
          gas and Coal). Then another 19% comes from nuclear energy and only 21%
          comes from renewable resources (Page. 2As a result, more fuel is
          burned to supply electricity to those clean air vehicles, which causes
          fuel reserves to dry out faster and more carbon dioxide to be emitted.
          Based on those facts, it is clear that the U.S. requires an
          alternative energy source. In the same article, U.S. electricity
          generation statistics are compared with those of Canada and there are
          some obvious differences between the two countries. Canada&rsquo;s
          major portion of electricity comes from hydro power, which is 60%
          while the US only generates 7% of the total electricity requirement
          from water. &nbsp;Canada only generates 17% of the electricity from
          Fossil fuels and they have set a huge step in the right direction when
          transitioning to renewable energy sources (Page. 2). Despite the fact
          of being neighbours globally, Canada and the United States have lots
          of climatic differences. For instance, many states of the U.S.
          &nbsp;have dry climates. They do not get enough water to generate
          electricity and it is obvious that the U.S. can&rsquo;t follow the
          footsteps of Canada regarding hydro electricity generation. They need
          to come up with a custom-tailored plan that fits the U.S. to step away
          from fossil fuels regarding electricity generation.</span

          >Predicting the direction of a nation requires knowing the preferences
          of the general public, especially in countries like the U.S. where
          citizens have the opportunity to vote on government decisions. People,
          however, tend to keep quiet as long as they can get electricity
          somehow. That is exactly what happened in Sri Lanka, the country that
          I mentioned earlier. Despite the fact of not having enough money to be
          spent on research, The country has enough resources that can be turned
          into hydroelectricity, solar power, wind power, and wave-tidal power.
          Unfortunately, people did not pay enough attention in transitioning to
          renewable energy sources. But, if considered the U.S. generally it
          seems that people do care,<span style="background: white"
            >&nbsp;at least for reversing climate change or to relieve the
            skyrocketing gas prices</span
          >. The Same reasons make people in the U.S. move toward electric
          vehicles. That is really a positive sign (even though the electricity
          does not come from fully greener sources.). What will their concern be
          about the source of electricity generation? &nbsp;In &ldquo;Public
          Preferences in a Shifting Energy Future&apos;&apos; by Hilary S Boudet
          and Shawn O Hazboun, the authors have provided official statistics on
          the people&apos;s preferences among all the sources of electricity
          generation. Those figures are based on several research done with the
          general public. According to those figures, solar energy is the
          highest demanded alternative and over 90% of the people have voted for
          increasing the usage of solar energy. The second place goes to wind
          energy with a preference percentage of 83% and wave-Tidal energy is at
          third place with 79% followed by Geothermal energy (69%) and
          Hydroelectricity (44%) (Page. 2). The personal opinions that I came up
          on this regard resonate with those numbers very closely. Solar and
          wind energy are excellent sources of energy despite the costs of
          installing the infrastructure. The Problem with most alternative
          energy resources is the fact that output could be very different from
          time to time. For example, you can&apos;t rely on solar energy for a
          whole year in a state like Washington. The sun is not shining over
          those states for the most part of the year. &nbsp;There are some
          situations where green energy does not actually turn out to be green.
          That is why scientific research should be done together with the
          public opinion before making the movement.</span

          >iscusses the methodology of the United States for elimination of
          fossil fuels and complete dependence on renewable energy by 2050. The
          article also includes the vision of Stanford professor Mark Jacobson
          vision in this regard. According to that, wind energy will be the
          primary source of electricity generation, which contributes 50 % of
          the national electricity generation. The second most used power source
          will be solar and it will contribute about 45% from total generation,
          hydroelectricity will be the third place contributing 3% and the rest
          will be coming from geothermal and tidal energy (Page. 3). Despite the
          fact of switching the order, Solar and wind will be the most used case
          just like preferred by the general public. Those figures were created
          assuming fossil fuel usage will be zero by then. Even the
          transportation will be solely dependent on electricity and Hydrogen.
          The reality, however, can be far from these research paper figures
          when it comes to stepping away from fossil fuels completely. The world
          is already suffering from difficulties finding materials for electric
          vehicle batteries. &nbsp;So, the manufacturers will have to slow down
          the production day by day going forward. That fact alone is enough to
          prove that the world has to stick with fossil fuel for much longer
          than expected time frame. The figures they have mentioned about the
          hydro electrics sounds realistic because water resources are not
          expanding over the time but energy consumption does. Obviously,
          it&apos;s clear that solar energy and wind will play a major part in
          the renewable energy future and I don&apos;t see a problem short
          listing those two energy sources for further discussion.</span

          >Due to the existing evidence, wind energy and solar energy will be
          the primary renewable forms of electricity generation in the U.S. in
          the future. However, the feasibility of implementing those
          infrastructures may leave some room for uncertainty. When starting off
          considering solar energy, it is obvious that surface area that is
          covered by solar panels will be the most considerable factor and of
          course the consistent sunny weather. According to the forecast by
          Welch, the 45% electricity generation will be the sum of 7.2 % from
          Domestic- Rooftop solar panels, 30.7% from solar farms, 7.3% from
          concentrated industrial solar farms (Page. 3). Otherwise, they will
          need huge battery stations to store the power. This is really
          challenging, but there is a possible solution. In &ldquo;<span
            >Stanford researchers get solar panels to produce electricity
            without sunlight</span

            produced by Stanford University which is capable of producing
            electricity at night (Par .1). This will be a huge game changer in
            the transitioning to renewable energy sources. Up next is the
            feasibility of Wind energy. The forecasts break down the predicted
            50% of electricity that gets from Wind energy to&nbsp;</span
          >19.1% from offshore wind and 30.9 % from onshore wind. Apart from the
          cost of implementing wind turbines and power stations, it seems like
          there are not many obstacles. But that is not true. Wind turbines
          hugely affect the lifestyles of airborne animals. According to
          &ldquo;An evaluation of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines in the
          Northeastern United States&rdquo; by Daniel Y. Choi, Thomas W. Wittig
          and Bryan M. Kluever, the U.S. has reported annual bird fatalities
          ranging from 140,000 to 679,000 belongs to 300 species (page. 2).
          Also, those turbines need to be adjusted according to the wind
          direction and the speed it will be a lot of work especially
          considering offshore wind turbines. However, when comparing with other
          available energy sources, it is obvious that solar and wind energy
          check almost all of the boxes on practicality, renewability and
          ultimately feasibility.</span

          >In conclusion, the future of transitioning to renewable energy
          sources can be imagined by comparing present statistics to public
          awareness, government preference and feasibility of available energy
          sources. It is nice to have the same directional opinions from general
          public and scientific research and it sounds like a plan. But no one
          knows what kind of technology will be implemented tomorrow. The future
          will totally depend on those technologies and outcomes will be
          adjusted accordingly. However, I believe the richer countries like the
          U.S. should lead the competition by finding the solutions for a
          greener future, then other countries have a path with footsteps to
          follow along. Greener future for the world depends entirely on the
          adherence of the countries of the world to this collective
