            Welcome to my portfolio, <br />
            First a small introduction. Im a enthusiastic ESL student of College
            of San Mateo who is putting the best effort to be good at english.
            Currently I'm pursuing a computer science degree with an ultimate
            goal of switching careers. This is my second semester. It is really
            important to me because I'm finishing up my ESL requirements for my
            degree. I believe I have made great progress in English down the
            road and can't wait to show off some of my writings that I have done
            for ESL 400 class. This website is all about them...<br />

              By today's standards, having English literacy is super important
              and highly rewarding to communicate with the society. But is it
              always true? Are there any downsides of learning english? In this
              essay that is what I'm going to discuss and express a concluding
              idea.

            Looking back at the last 3 months, I can say that this has been my
            most intensive time frame ever. I had to allocate time between the
            full time school and full time work. On top of that, I started a
            coding program two weeks before the end of the semester. I had some
            situations where I couldn't figure out what to do next. I ultimately
            made it to the finals of all four classes I attended, with very good
            academic progress. <br /><br />
            When it comes to ESL400 class, Knowing Prof. Kaiser's teaching style
            from last semester was extremely beneficial to me. Just that fact
            alone helped me navigate through my assignments as well as build my
            confidence to manage life, work, and school commitments
            simultaneously. I really wanted to be in his class for ENGLISH 105
            in the fall semester, but somehow it is not happening.
            <br /><br />This class taught me the correct techniques for using
            the study materials. It improved my productivity a lot. Also I liked
            the prompts of all three essays that were given to me. It was
            enjoyable to be able to relate my own life experiences to the three
            essays. In this way I managed to add a "great hook" to each essay.
            The most interesting part for me in this class is the portfolio
            website assessment. It let me put my web development skills to good
            use. I'm happy with the final outcome.<br /><br />
            As a result of having so much stuff to do, I developed a bad habit
            of submitting work at the last minute. I made several submissions at
            11.50-12.00 midnight of the due date. It was not fun at all. Next
            semester, I pledged to break that habit.<br /><br />
            It was a wonderful experience to accomplish something after an
            intensive workload, even if it was stressful.That is the feeling in
            my mind right now. <br /><br />Once again… Thanks for stopping by..
            Cheers!.
